## Tools

<!-- List of tools that are useful for OCR processing of Buddhist texts with description and links to the tool. -->

- [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/drag-and-drop) - Google Vision API is the currently the best performing OCR Model for the Tibetan Buddhist text images, which is available via google cloud console and is a paid service.
- [Namsel OCR](https://github.com/thubtenrigzin/namsel-ocr) - Namsel OCR is a model trained on Machine printed Tibetan text images, which is an open-source project.
- [Monlam-BDRC OCR](https://huggingface.co/BDRC/Woodblock/blob/main/Woodblock.onnx) - This OCR model made in collaboration between Monlam and BDRC, which is trained on woodblock printed images and is Easter2 model architecture.

## Libraries

<!-- Include libraries that support the development of OCR applications specifically tailored for Buddhist scriptures. -->

- [Openpecha-toolkit](https://github.com/OpenPecha/Toolkit) - Openpecha-toolkit is a python package which converts the Google OCR and Google Books output data into Openpecha format, which in turn can be converted into .txt, .docs, .epub and .hfml formats.
## Datasets

<!-- Mention any datasets that are particularly useful for training OCR models on Buddhist texts. -->

- Lhasa Kanjur - We took 10 volumn's line images with its inference and corrected by annotators, we have about 160k line images with annotations. Sourced from BDRC W26071
- Derge Tenjur - We have about 676K line images of the Derge Tenjur line images and its transcripts
- Lithang Kanjur - We have about 25 GB line images and its transcripts

## Research Papers

<!-- Reference research papers that focus on OCR technology as it applies to Buddhist texts or similar scripts. -->

- [TrOCR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10282) - TrOCR is OCR model architecture based on transformer model.
- [Easter2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14879) - Easter2 is OCR model based on the Convlutional Neural 

## Websites

<!-- Include any websites that provide resources, forums, or articles on Buddhist OCR. -->
